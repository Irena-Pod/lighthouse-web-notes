#### How to solve a problem? ####
- When we first have a problem, first thing to do is create a new repo in GitHub.
- Pseudocode

**Git commands**
- git init <--- initialized our repo
- git status
- git branch -M main <--- to rename from master to main (new naming convention)
- git remote add origin [URL]
- git push origin master (can be different if using main instead of master "git push -u origin main" and then just "git push" after that)
- git dif <---- will tell you the changes you made
- git add . <---- add everyting in this folder (so don't have to add each file seperately)
- git chechout [file name] <--- revert back to previous commit
