A function is a first-class citizen (first-class object).
- a function behaves like any other value
- it can be passed as an argument to another function
- a function can return another function

Function expressions = function that doesn't start with 'function' keyword in front. Function call before the function definition won't work with a function expression.

Function declaration starts with the word 'function'. Function declaration gets hoisted.

Should favour functions that are concise and not alot of code. 

### Single Responsibility Principle ###
A function should be doing only one thing.
